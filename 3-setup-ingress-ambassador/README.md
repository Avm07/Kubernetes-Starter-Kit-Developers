### Options for Load Balancer and Ingress

In most of the cases, you will use the `Load Balancer` that is made available by the `Cloud` provider of your choice. In case of `DigitalOcean` when you configure a service as a `Load Balancer`, `DOKS` automatically provisions one in your account (unless you configure to use an existing one). Now the `service` is exposed to the outside world and can be accessed via the `Load Balancer` endpoint. In a real world scenario you do not want to use one `Load Balancer` per service so you need a `proxy` inside the cluster. That is `Ingress`.

When an `Ingress Proxy` is installed it creates a service and exposes it as a `Load Balancer`. Now you can have as many services behind the ingress and all accessible through a single endpoint. Ingress operates at the `HTTP` layer.

Let us say you are exposing `REST` or `GRPC` APIs for different tasks (reading account info, writing orders, searching orders, etc.). Depending on the `API` you will want to be able to route to a specific target. For this to happen more functionality needs to be built inside the ingress proxy. That is `API Gateway` and it is capable of doing more things besides routing traffic. For this tutorial you are going to pick an ingress that can do both `HTTP` routing and `API Gateway`.

As there are many vendors, `Kubernetes API` has an `Ingress` spec. The idea is that developers should be able to use the `Ingress API` and it should work with any vendor. That works well but has limited capability in the current version. The new version of ingress is called `Gateway API` and is currently in alpha. The idea is the same - users should be able to provide a rich set of ingress configuration using the `Gateway API` syntax. As long as the vendor supports it users will be able to manage the ingress in a vendor-agnostic way.

You will use the `Ambassador Edge Stack` in this tutorial. You can pick any `Ingress/API Gateway` solution as long as it has good support from the community because you may want more options to be available in the near future as well.

Why use the `Ambassador Edge Stack`?

`Ambassador Edge Stack` gives platform engineers a comprehensive, self-service edge stack for managing the boundary between `end-users` and `Kubernetes`. Built on the `Envoy Proxy` and fully `Kubernetes-native`, `Ambassador Edge Stack` is made to support multiple, independent teams that need to rapidly publish, monitor, and update services for end-users. A true edge stack, `Ambassador Edge Stack` can also be used to handle the functions of an `API Gateway`, a `Kubernetes ingress controller` and a `layer 7 load balancer`.


### Ambassador Edge Stack Overview

The `Ambassador Edge Stack` or `AES` for short, is a specialized [Control Plane](https://blog.getambassador.io/the-importance-of-control-planes-with-service-meshes-and-front-proxies-665f90c80b3d) for the `Envoy Proxy`. In this architecture, `Ambassador Edge Stack` translates configuration (in the form of `Kubernetes Custom Resources`) to `Envoy` configuration. All the actual traffic is directly handled by the high-performance [Envoy Proxy](https://www.envoyproxy.io).

At a very high level `AES` works as follows:

1.  The service owner defines configuration via `Kubernetes` manifests.
2.  When the manifest is applied to the cluster, the `Kubernetes API` notifies `Ambassador Edge Stack` of the change.
3.  `Ambassador Edge Stack` parses the change and transforms the configuration into a semantic intermediate representation. `Envoy` configuration is generated from this `IR`.
4.  The new configuration is passed to `Envoy` via the `gRPC-based Aggregated Discovery Service (ADS) API`.
5.  Traffic flows through the reconfigured `Envoy`, without dropping any connections.

For more details and in depth explanation please visit: [The Ambassador Edge Stack Architecture](https://www.getambassador.io/docs/edge-stack/2.0/topics/concepts/architecture) 

`AES` configuration steps:

1. Install `AES`.
2. Configure two hosts (`quote`, `echo`) on the cluster. For this example we're going to use `quote.mandake.xyz` and `echo.mandrake.xyz`.
3. Hosts will have `TLS` termination enabled.
4. Verify the installation.

This is how the `Ambassador Edge Stack` setup will look like after following the steps:

### Ambassador Edge Stack Deployment

In this section you will deploy the `Ambassador Edge Stack` into the `DOKS` cluster via [Helm](https://helm.sh).

Steps to follow:

1. Clone the `Starter Kit` repository and change directory to your local copy.
2. Add the Helm repo and list the available charts:

    ```shell
    helm repo add datawire https://www.getambassador.io

    helm search repo datawire
    ```

    The output looks similar to the following:
    ```
    NAME                            CHART VERSION   APP VERSION     DESCRIPTION                                       
    datawire/ambassador             6.7.13          1.13.10         A Helm chart for Datawire Ambassador              
    datawire/ambassador-operator    0.3.0           v1.3.0          A Helm chart for Kubernetes                       
    datawire/telepresence           2.4.0           2.4.0           A chart for deploying the server-side component...
    ```

    **Note:**

    The chart of interes is `datawire/ambassador`, which will install `Ambassador Edge Stack` on the cluster. Please visit the [ambassador-chart](https://github.com/datawire/ambassador-chart) page for more details about this chart.
3. Edit and adjust as needed the `3-setup-ingress-ambassador/res/manifests/ambassador-values-v6.7.13.yaml` file provided in the `Starter Kit` repository, using an editor of your choice (preferably with `YAML` lint support).
4. Next, finish the installation (a dedicated `ambassador` namespace will be created as well):

    ```shell
    HELM_CHART_VERSION="6.7.13"

    helm install ambassador datawire/ambassador --version "$HELM_CHART_VERSION" \
        --namespace ambassador \
        --create-namespace \
        -f "3-setup-ingress-ambassador/res/manifests/ambassador-values-v${HELM_CHART_VERSION}.yaml"
    ```

    **Note:**

    A `specific` version for the `Helm` chart is used. In this case `6.7.13` was picked, which maps to the `1.13.10` release of `AES` (see the output from `Step 1.`). It's good practice in general to lock on a specific version or range (e.g. `^6.7.13`). This helps to have predictable results, and to avoid future issues caused by breaking changes introduced in major version releases. On the other hand, it doesn't mean that a future major version ugrade is not an option. You need to make sure that the new version is tested first. Having a good strategy in place for backups and snapshots becomes handy here (covered in more detail in [Section 6 - Backup Using Velero](../6-setup-velero)).


### Defining the Domain and Hosts

In a real world scenario each `host` maps to a `service` so you need a way to tell `AES` about your intentions - meet the [Host](https://www.getambassador.io/docs/edge-stack/1.13/topics/running/host-crd/) CRD.

The custom `Host` resource defines how `Ambassador Edge Stack` will be visible to the outside world. It collects all the following information in a single configuration resource. The most relevant parts are:

* The `hostname` by which `Ambassador Edge Stack` will be reachable
* How `Ambassador Edge Stack` should handle `TLS` certificates
* How `Ambassador Edge Stack` should handle secure and insecure requests

For more details please visit the [AES Host CRD](https://www.getambassador.io/docs/edge-stack/1.13/topics/running/host-crd/) official documentation.

Notes on `ACME` support:

* If the `Authority` is not supplied then a `Letâ€™s Encrypt` **production environment** is assumed.
* In general the `registrant email address` is mandatory when using `ACME` and it should be a valid one in order to receive notifications when the certificates are going to expire.
* `ACME` stores certificates using `Kubernetes Secrets`. The name of the secret can be set using the `tlsSecret` element.

The following example will configure the `TLS` enabled `hosts` for this tutorial: [echo_host](res/manifests/echo_host.yaml) and [quote_host](res/manifests/quote_host.yaml).

Steps to follow:

1. Change directory where the `Starter Kit` repository was cloned.
2. Apply the manifests:

    ```shell
    kubectl apply -f 3-setup-ingress-ambassador/res/manifests/echo_host.yaml

    kubectl apply -f 3-setup-ingress-ambassador/res/manifests/quote_host.yaml
    ```
3. Review the hosts that were created:

    ```shell
    kubectl get hosts -n ambassador
    ```

    The output looks similar to the following:

    ```
    NAME         HOSTNAME                   STATE     PHASE COMPLETED      PHASE PENDING              AGE
    echo-host    echo.starterkits.online    Pending   ACMEUserRegistered   ACMECertificateChallenge   3s
    quote-host   quote.starterkits.online   Pending   ACMEUserRegistered   ACMECertificateChallenge   3s
    ```

**Observations and results:**

It takes around `30s` to get the signed certificate for the hosts. At this point you have the `Ambassador Edge Stack` installed and the hosts configured. But you still don't have the networking (eg. `DNS` and `Load Balancer`) configured to route traffic to the cluster. The missing parts can be noticed in the `Kubernetes` events of the hosts that you configured earlier.

Take a look and see what happens for the `echo-host`:

```shell
kubectl describe host echo-host -n ambassador
```

The output looks similar to the following:

```

...
```
As seen above, the last event tells that there's no `A` record to point to the `echo` host for the `starterkits.online` domain which results in a lookup failure. Let's fix this in the next section of the tutorial.


### Configuring Domain Mappings

Adding a domain you own to your `DigitalOcean` account lets you manage the domainâ€™s `DNS` records via the `Control Panel` and `API`. Domains you manage on `DigitalOcean` also integrate with `DigitalOcean Load Balancers` and `Spaces` to streamline automatic `SSL` certificate management.

What you need to do next is to create a `domain` and add the required `A` records for the new hosts: `echo` and `quote`. You can do that using the [doctl](https://docs.digitalocean.com/reference/doctl/how-to/install) utility.

First, you create a new `domain` (`starterkits.online` in this example):

```shell
doctl compute domain create starterkits.online
```

The output looks similar to the following:

```
Domain           TTL
starterkits.online    0
```

**Note:**

**YOU NEED TO ENSURE THAT YOUR DOMAIN REGISTRAR IS CONFIGURED TO POINT TO DO NAMESERVERS**. More information on how to do that is available [here](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-point-to-digitalocean-nameservers-from-common-domain-registrars).

Let's add some `A` records now for the hosts created earlier. First, you need to identify the `Load Balancer` IP that points to your `Kubernetes` cluster (one should be already available when the cluster was created). Pick the one that matches your configuration from the list:

```shell
doctl compute load-balancer list
```

Then add the records (please replace the `<>` placheholders accordingly):

```shell
doctl compute domain records create starterkits.online --record-type "A" --record-name "echo" --record-data "<your_lb_ip_address>"
doctl compute domain records create starterkits.online --record-type "A" --record-name "quote" --record-data "<your_lb_ip_address>"
```

**Note:**

If you have only one `LB` in your account then this snippet should help:

```shell
LOAD_BALANCER_IP=$(doctl compute load-balancer list --format IP --no-header)
doctl compute domain records create starterkits.online --record-type "A" --record-name "echo" --record-data "$LOAD_BALANCER_IP"
doctl compute domain records create starterkits.online --record-type "A" --record-name "quote" --record-data "$LOAD_BALANCER_IP"
```

**Observation and results:**

List the available records for the `starterkits.online` domain:

```shell
doctl compute domain records list starterkits.online
```

The output looks similar to the following:

```
ID           Type    Name     Data                    Priority    Port    TTL     Weight
164171755    SOA     @        1800                    0           0       1800    0
164171756    NS      @        ns1.digitalocean.com    0           0       1800    0
164171757    NS      @        ns2.digitalocean.com    0           0       1800    0
164171758    NS      @        ns3.digitalocean.com    0           0       1800    0
164171801    A       echo     143.244.208.191         0           0       3600    0
164171809    A       quote    143.244.208.191         0           0       3600    0
```

Great! Now let's see if the `AES Hosts` are OK:

```shell
kubectl get hosts -n ambassador
```

The output looks similar to the following:

```
NAME         HOSTNAME                   STATE   PHASE COMPLETED   PHASE PENDING   AGE
echo-host    echo.starterkits.online    Ready                                     2m11s
quote-host   quote.starterkits.online   Ready                                     2m12s
```

If the `STATE` column prints `Ready` then awesome! Now you're ready to rock!

At this point the network traffic will reach the `AES enabled` cluster but you need to configure the `backend services paths` for each of the hosts. All `DNS` records have one thing in common: `TTL` or time to live. It determines how long a `record` can remain cached before it expires. Loading data from a local cache is faster but visitors wonâ€™t see `DNS` changes until their local cache expires and gets updated after a new `DNS` lookup. As a result, higher `TTL` values give visitors faster performance and lower `TTL` values ensure that `DNS` changes are picked up quickly. All `DNS` records require a minimum `TTL` value of `30 seconds`.

Please visit the [How to Create, Edit and Delete DNS Records](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/networking/dns/how-to/manage-records) page for more information.

In the next part you will create two simple backend services (applications). These are just simple examples that will help you test the `Ambassador` setup.


### Creating AES Backend Services

In this section you will deploy two example `backend` services (applications), named `echo` and `quote`. The main goal here is to have a basic understanding on how the `AES` stack will route requests to each application by introducing a new custom `AES` resource. Meet the [Mapping]((https://www.getambassador.io/docs/edge-stack/1.13/topics/using/intro-mappings)) CRD.

You can have multiple `TLS` enabled `hosts` on the same cluster. On the other hand you can have multiple `deployments` and `services` as well. So for each `backend application` a corresponding `Kubernetes Deployment` and `Service` has to be created.

First, you define a new `namespace` for the `quote` and `echo` backend applications. This is a good practice because you don't want to pollute the `AES` space (or any other) with application specific stuff.

Steps to follow:

1. Change directory where the `Starter Kit` repository was cloned.
2. Create the `backend` namespace:

    ```shell
    kubectl create ns backend
    ```
3. Deploy [echo](res/manifests/echo_deployment.yaml) and [quote](res/manifests/quote_deployment.yaml) applications:

    ```shell
    kubectl apply -f 3-setup-ingress-ambassador/res/manifests/echo_deployment.yaml

    kubectl apply -f 3-setup-ingress-ambassador/res/manifests/quote_deployment.yaml
    ```
4. Define the corresponding `services`:

    ```shell
    kubectl apply -f 3-setup-ingress-ambassador/res/manifests/echo_service.yaml

    kubectl apply -f 3-setup-ingress-ambassador/res/manifests/quote_service.yaml
    ```

**Observation and results:**

Inspect the `deployments` and `services` you just created:

```shell
kubectl get deployments -n backend
```

The output looks similar to the following:

```
NAME    READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
echo    1/1     1            1           2m22s
quote   1/1     1            1           2m23s
```

```shell
kubectl get svc -n backend
```

The output looks similar to the following:

```
NAME    TYPE        CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)   AGE
echo    ClusterIP   10.245.175.185   <none>        80/TCP    2m32s
quote   ClusterIP   10.245.158.116   <none>        80/TCP    2m33s
```

In the next part you will create the `Mappings` for Ambassador.


### Configuring AES Mappings for Hosts

`Ambassador Edge Stack` is designed around a [declarative, self-service management model](https://www.getambassador.io/docs/edge-stack/latest/topics/concepts/gitops-continuous-delivery). It means that you can manage the `Edge` via a dedicated `Kubernetes CRD`, namely the `Mapping` resource. More info about [Mappings](https://www.getambassador.io/docs/edge-stack/1.13/topics/using/intro-mappings) can be found on the official page.

What a `Mapping` does is to manage routing for all inbound traffic to the `/quote/` path for the `quote` service and `/echo/` for the `echo` service.

**Mapping fields description:**

* `name` - a string identifying the `Mapping` (e.g. in diagnostics).
* `prefix` - the `URL` prefix identifying your resource.
* `service` - the name of the service handling the resource; must include the `namespace` (e.g. myservice.othernamespace) if the service is in a different namespace than `Ambassador Edge Stack`.

Steps to follow:

1. Change directory where the `Starter Kit` repository was cloned.
2. Create a `Mapping` for `echo` and `quote` backend application:

    ```shell
    kubectl apply -f 3-setup-ingress-ambassador/res/manifests/echo_mapping.yaml

    kubectl apply -f 3-setup-ingress-ambassador/res/manifests/quote_mapping.yaml
    ```

**Observation and results:**

Inspecting the results:

```shell
kubectl get mappings -n ambassador
```

The output looks similar to the following (notice the `echo-backend` and `quote-backend` lines):

```
NAME                          SOURCE HOST                SOURCE PREFIX                               DEST SERVICE     STATE   REASON
ambassador-devportal                                     /documentation/                             127.0.0.1:8500           
ambassador-devportal-api                                 /openapi/                                   127.0.0.1:8500           
ambassador-devportal-assets                              /documentation/(assets|styles)/(.*)(.css)   127.0.0.1:8500           
ambassador-devportal-demo                                /docs/                                      127.0.0.1:8500           
echo-backend                  echo.starterkits.online    /echo/                                      echo.backend             
quote-backend                 quote.starterkits.online   /quote/                                     quote.backend 
```

**Next Steps**

Further explore some of the concepts you learned about so far:

* [Mapping](https://www.getambassador.io/docs/edge-stack/1.13/topics/using/intro-mappings/) resource: `routes` traffic from the `edge` of your cluster to a `Kubernetes` service
* [Host](https://www.getambassador.io/docs/edge-stack/1.13/topics/running/host-crd/) resource: sets the `hostname` by which `Ambassador Edge Stack` will be accessed and secured with `TLS` certificates


### Enabling Proxy Protocol

L4 load balancer replaces the original client IP with its own IP address. This is a problem, as we lose the client IP visibility in the application. Hence we enable proxy protocol. Proxy protocol enables a `L4 Load Balancer` to communicate the original `client IP`. For this to work you need to configure both `DigitalOcean Load Balancer` and `AES`. After deploying the [AES Backend Services](#creating-aes-backend-services), and manually enabling the `proxy protocol`, you need to configure `Ambassador Module` to enable `AES` to use the proxy protocol. 

So, the steps for proxy protocol are the following:
1. Enable `proxy` protocol on `DigitalOcean` LB through service `annotation` on `Ambassador` LB service.
2. Enable `proxy` protocol configuration on `Ambassador module`. 

For different DO LB configurations, please refer to the examples from the official [DigitalOcean Cloud Controller Manager](https://github.com/digitalocean/digitalocean-cloud-controller-manager/tree/master/docs/controllers/services/examples) documentation. Proxy protocol on the LB is enabled with the following `annotation` on `Ambassador` LB service: `service.beta.kubernetes.io/do-loadbalancer-enable-proxy-protocol: "true"`. You must NOT create a load balancer with `Proxy` support by using the `DO` web console, as any setting done outside `DOKS` is automatically `overridden` by DOKS `reconciliation`. 

You can enable proxy support in the `Ambassador` stack via the [aes_proxy_module](res/manifests/aes_proxy_module.yaml) manifest.

Change directory where the `Starter Kit` repository was cloned and:

```shell
kubectl apply -f 3-setup-ingress-ambassador/res/manifests/aes_proxy_module.yaml
```

Please note that module configuration is a `global` option (enable/disable) for `AES`.


### Verifying the AES Setup

In the current setup you have two hosts configured with `TLS` termination and `ACME` protocol: `quote.starterkits.online` and `echo.starterkits.online`. By creating AES `Mappings` it's very easy to have `TLS` termination support and `API Gateway` capabilities. 

If pinging `quote.starterkits.online` or `echo.starterkits.online` in the terminal you can see that packets are being sent to the `AES` external `IP`. Then, `AES` is using the mapping feature to reach the endpoints. 

```shell
kubectl get svc -n ambassador 
```

The output looks similar to the following:

```

```

```shell
ping quote.starterkits.online
```

The output looks similar to the following:

```
PING quote.starterkits.online (68.183.252.190): 56 data bytes
64 bytes from 68.183.252.190: icmp_seq=0 ttl=54 time=199.863 ms
64 bytes from 68.183.252.190: icmp_seq=1 ttl=54 time=202.999 ms
...
```

As explained above, notice that it hits the `AES` external IP (`68.183.252.190`).

Test the backend services now via `curl`, using the `quote` service first. You can also inspect and see the results in a web browser if desired.

```shell
curl -Li http://quote.starterkits.online/quote/
```

The output looks similar to the following (notice how it automatically redirects and uses `https` instead):

```

}
```

Let's do the same for the `echo` service:

```shell
curl -Li http://echo.starterkits.online/echo/
```

The output looks similar to the following (notice how it automatically redirects and uses `https` instead):
```
HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently

Given that proxy protocol is configured, you should see the original `client IP` in the https `request header`.

If everything looks like above, you configured the `Ambassador Edge Stack` successfully. 

### Performance Considerations for the AES

The performance of `Ambassador Edge Stack's` control plane can be characterized along a number of different `dimensions`. The following list contains each `dimension` that has an impact at the application level:

* The number of `TLSContext` resources.
* The number of `Host` resources.
* The number of `Mapping` resources per Host resource.
* The number of `unconstrained Mapping resources` (these will apply to all `Host` resources).

Taking each key factor from above into consideration and mapping it to the Kubernetes realm, it means that you need to adjust the `requests` and `limits` for the deployment pods, and/or the `replica` count. When it comes to scaling, `Kubernetes` will generally kill an `Ambassador Edge Stack` pod for one of two reasons: `exceeding memory limits` or `failed liveness/readiness` probes.

`Ambassador Edge Stack` can `grow` in terms of `memory usage` so it's very likely to get the application pods killed because of `OOM` issues. Having a system for indexing application logs comes very handy in this situation (covered in more detail in [Section 5 - Logs Aggregation via Loki Stack](../5-setup-loki-stack)). 

In general you should try to keep AES `memory usage` below `50%` of the pod's `limit`. This may seem like a generous safety margin, but when reconfiguration occurs, `Ambassador Edge Stack` requires `additional memory to avoid disrupting active connections`.

Going further, what you can do on the `Kubernetes` side is to adjust the `replica count` and resource `requests` for pods. 

**Adjusting the replica count**

Based on our findings, a value of `2`, should suffice in case of small development environments.

In the next part, you're going to scale the deployment via `Helm` and adjust the `replicaCount` field by editing the [ambassador-values.yaml](res/manifests/ambassador-values-v6.7.13.yaml) file provided in this `Git` repository.

Steps to follow:

1. Change directory where the `Starter Kit` Git repository was cloned.
2. Search for `replicaCount` in the [ambassador-values](res/manifests/ambassador-values-v6.7.13.yaml#L14) file, and change the value to `2`.
3. Run a `Helm` upgrade:

    ```shell
    HELM_CHART_VERSION="6.7.13"

    helm upgrade ambassador datawire/ambassador --version "$HELM_CHART_VERSION" \
        --namespace ambassador \
        -f "3-setup-ingress-ambassador/res/manifests/ambassador-values-v${HELM_CHART_VERSION}.yaml"
    ```
4. After a while, check the `ambassador` deployment:

    ```shell
    kubectl get deployments -n ambassador
    ```

    The output looks similar to:

    ```
    NAME               READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
    ambassador         2/2     3            3           6d3h
    ambassador-agent   1/1     1            1           6d3h
    ambassador-redis   1/1     1            1           6d3h
    ```

**Adjusting pods resource requests**

Based on our findings, the requests for memory should be adjusted to a value of `200m`, which cover most development needs in general. 

In the next part, you're going to adjust memory requests via `Helm` and adjust the `memory` requests field by editing the [ambassador-values.yaml](res/manifests/ambassador-values-v6.7.13.yaml) file provided in this `Git` repository.

Steps to follow:

1. Change directory where the `Starter Kit` Git repository was cloned.
2. Search for `resources -> requests -> memory` in the [ambassador-values](res/manifests/ambassador-values-v6.7.13.yaml#L288) line and change the value to `200Mi`.
3. Run a `Helm` upgrade:

    ```shell
    HELM_CHART_VERSION="6.7.13"

    helm upgrade ambassador datawire/ambassador --version "$HELM_CHART_VERSION" \
        --namespace ambassador \
        -f "3-setup-ingress-ambassador/res/manifests/ambassador-values-v${HELM_CHART_VERSION}.yaml"
    ```
4. Check the memory requests new value - it should say `200Mi` (look in the `Containers` section from the command output):

    ```shell
    kubectl describe deployment ambassador -n ambassador
    ```

    The output looks similar to:

    ```
    ...
    Containers:
      ambassador:
       Image:       docker.io/datawire/aes:1.13.10
       Ports:       8080/TCP, 8443/TCP, 8877/TCP
       Host Ports:  0/TCP, 0/TCP, 0/TCP
       Limits:
         cpu:     1
         memory:  600Mi
       Requests:
         cpu:      200m
         memory:   200Mi
    ...
    ```

Another way of finding and setting the right values for requests/limits, is to evaluate `Ambassador` for a period of time (a few days or so). Then, you can run statistical queries via `Prometheus` and find the best values for your use case. A good article to read on this topic can be found [here](https://blog.kubecost.com/blog/requests-and-limits).

**Next steps**

`Monitoring` and `Logging` is a very important aspect of every `production ready` system. In the sections to follow, you will learn how to enable it via `Prometheus` and `Loki` for the `AES` stack as well as other backend services.
